# VSCode - CharacterCount README
 
This is a simple extension that counts the number of characters in a file in VS Code.  

## Functionality

It's pretty simple open up any file and the status bar will have an auto-updating wordcount in it that looks like `#### Characters` on the Right

This extension was based fairly heavily on the [Microsoft](https://microsoft.com/) [WordCount Extension](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-wordcount), but expanded quite a bit.
